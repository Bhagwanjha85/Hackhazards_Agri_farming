## üìå Problem Statement

Modern greenhouse farming faces significant challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, CO‚ÇÇ levels, and soil moisture. Manual monitoring and control of these factors can be inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming, especially when constant attention is required. As a result, it becomes difficult to ensure consistent plant health, maximize yields, and reduce resource wastage.



## üéØ Objective

Today, greenhouse farming is over major challenges in maintaining ideal conditions for crop development. Fluctuations in temperature, humidity, CO and level and soil moisture can directly affect plant health and reduce the yield. Manually handling these factors is often disabled, exposed to time -consuming and human errors, especially when continuous monitoring is needed.

### Your Approach:  
- Today, greenhouse farming is over major challenges in maintaining ideal conditions for crop development. Fluctuations in temperature, humidity, CO and level and soil moisture can directly affect plant health and reduce the yield. Manually handling these factors is often disabled, exposed to time -consuming and human errors, especially when continuous monitoring is needed.


To solve this, I developed a smart greenhouse simulation that uses real -time sensation data to monitor large environmental factors and automatically check units such as fans, lights, moisturizes and water pumps. The system also provides a live, visually rich dashboard that allows farmers to easily track circumstances and make informed decisions far away.


By automating monitoring and control, my project helps farmers maintain a healthy greenhouse environment, reduce manual workload, adapt resource use and finally achieve better crop productivity.

- Challenges and its solution:
- One of the most important challenges was to handle real -time sense data updates without backlog, especially when many units need to be checked at the same time. Originally, the system met a delay in reflecting data changes on the dashboard.

To solve this, we included data using asynchronous operations and communication techniques in real time and adapted to the unit control logic. We corrected the update gaps to balance performance and accuracy, ensuring even and responsible monitoring.

Another obstacle was to ensure reliable control of several hardware components in simulation. Careful testing, handling of errors and refining of control flows helped us remove these problems and build a stable system.


- During the development process, we initially focused on building a simple dashboard with basic sensor data monitoring. However, after brainstorming, we realized the need for real-time device control to make the system more interactive and efficient. This led to a major pivot where we integrated automatic control of devices like fans, lights, and water pumps based on the sensor readings.

- Breakthroughs 
- One of the key breakthroughs came when we decided to use asynchronous operations for real-time data fetching and processing. This allowed the system to run smoothly without any lag, ensuring that data was updated and reflected instantly on the dashboard. We also experimented with data visualization techniques, using Chart.js, to better present the data, which made the dashboard not only functional but also visually appealing.

Another important moment was when we realized that incorporating remote access would give farmers more flexibility. This idea quickly turned into a breakthrough feature, allowing greenhouse managers to control the environment from anywhere, significantly enhancing the project‚Äôs value.
